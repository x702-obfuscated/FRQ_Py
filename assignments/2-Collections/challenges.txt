"A constraint is a rule that tells you what you can or cannot do when solving a problem."

[.]     Define a variable named 'empty' and assign it an empty list.
        Constraints:
            You may not use the list constructor call. 


[.]     Define a variable named 'my_letters' and assign it a list containing 
        the individual characters of your first name. 
        Constraints:
            You may not use the list constructor call. 


[.]     Define a variable name 'arabic_numerals' and assign it a list containing the characters 0-9.
        Use the list constructor to create the list. 
        Constraints:
            The list must contain characters, not integers
            The list must be created using the list constructor function. 




Define a variable named 'upper_alpha' and assign it to reference a list of all the uppercase characters in the alphabet.
Define a variable named 'lower_alpha' and assign it to reference a list of all the lowercase characters in the alphabet.  
Define a variable named 'numerals' and assign it to reference a list of the integers 0 to 9

[.]     Define a variable named 'character' and assign it any character of your choice. 
        Print each of the following expressions: 
            check if the value of 'character' is in 'upper_alpha'
            check if the value of 'character' is in 'lower_alpha'
            check if the value of 'character' is in 'numerals'
        
        Constraints:
            The expression must be directly printed, and not assigned to a variable
