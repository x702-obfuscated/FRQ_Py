[ Simple Functions and Calls : Challenges                                               ]


[1.]    Define a function with the name 'add' that has two parameters one named 'a', and one named 'b'.
        The function should return the sum of 'a' and 'b'

[2.]    Call the 'add' function that you just defined provide 6 as the first argument, and 4 as the second argument.
        Declare a variable named 'twosum' and assign it to the result of the 'add' function call
        Print out the value of 'twosum'


[3.]    Define a function with the name 'subtract' that has two parameters one named 'minuend', and one named 'subtrahend'.
        The function should return the difference of 'minuend' and 'subtrahend'

[4.]    Call the 'subtract' function and provide 1024 as the first argument, and provide 512 as the second argument.
        Declare a variable named 'twodiff' and assign it to the result of the 'subtract' function call. 
        Print out the value of 'twodiff'


[5.]    Define a function with the name 'multiply' that has two parameters one named 'x', and one named 'y'.
        The function should return the product of 'x' and 'y'

[6.]    Call the 'multiply' function and provide 128 as the first argument, and provide 8 as the second argument.
        Declare a variable named 'twoproduct' and assign it to the result of the 'multiply' function call. 
        Print out the value of 'twoproduct'


[7.]    Define a function with the name 'divide' that has two parameters one named 'dividend', and one named 'divisor'.
        The function should return the quotient of 'dividend' and 'divisor'

[8.]    Call the 'divide' function and provide 65536 as the first argument, and provide 1024 as the second argument.
        Declare a variable named 'twoquotient' and assign it to the result of the 'divide' function call. 
        Print out the value of 'twoquotient'


[9.]    Define a function with the name 'concatenate' that has two parameters one named 'front_half', and one named 'back_half'.
        The function should return 'front_half' concatenated with 'back_half'.

[10.]   Call the 'concatenate' function and provide "It means " as the first argument, and provide "to join together." as the second argument.
        Declare a variable named 'joined' and assign it to the result of the 'concatenate' function call. 
        Print out the value of 'joined'


[11.]   Using a single print call and without using the 'sep' parameter, print out the following values on the same line with a single space in between.
        "Its"
        "not"
        "a"
        "bug"
        "its"
        "a"
        "feature"


[12.]   Using a separate print statement for each string value below, print all values on the same output line with no extra spaces.
        "Its "
        "a "
        "twist "
        "ENDing."

        None of these print calls should result in the cursor moving to the next line. 



[13.]   Using a single print call, print out the following values on the same line separated by a pipe character "|" (Hint: look above the ENTER key on your keyboard.)
            "First"
            "Second"
            "Third"
            "Fourth"


[14.]   Write a python input statement that:
            1. prompts the user to "Enter a number:\n"
            2. converts the input into an integer
            3. stores the integer in a variable named 'num'
        
            1-3 should all be on the same line in the same statement.
        
        Print out the value of  num multiplied by 5 to the console.



[15.]   Write a python input statement that:
            1. prompts the user to "Enter a number:\n"
            2. converts the input into a float
            3. stores the float in a variable named 'flo'
            
            1-3 should all be on the same line in the same statement.
        
        Print out the value of  flo multiplied by 3.14  to the console.
        
[16.]   Write a separate Python print statement that prints out the length of the following strings:
        "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz" 
        "a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z "

        THINK ABOUT IT: Why is the length different?
